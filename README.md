PORTFOLIO SITE
=============

This is just a portfolio site for my Udacity course.

Brief summary
---------------
Unfortunately I don't really have anything to share as my portfolio. So I've just opted to use the same content as shown in the mockup pdf file.

I used bootstrap 4.0 as the main framework. The only 2 custom files I've created to complete this project are:

```
index.html
css/style.css
```
